    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <P>My name is Emamezi Iruoghene Orezimena and I am an aspiring software engineer undergoing a six months training at
        Stutern. I am intrigued by how the web works, with special interest on how users interact with the web across
        devices. Last year, I took a course in UX/UI Design which in my opinion, focuses on creating effective design
        solutions to meet user and business needs. I recently picked interest in actually knowing how these intuitive
        designs can be transformed into workable solutions through writing codes.</P>

    <p>This is my third week at Stutern and so far, I have learned:
    <ul>
        <li>The roles of a frontend developer, backend developer, full stack developer, mobile developer and a software
            tester</li>
        <li>The basics of making use of some Git command lines in creating and manipulating files through the terminal
        </li>
        <li>The benefits of Git and Github</li>
        <li>How to create a repository in Github</li>
        <li>How to create and navigate through branches of a repository</li>
        <li>The difference between cloning and forking a repository</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The part I enjoy most is collaborating with others as it helps in sharing of ideas, forming a community to help
        each other grow and achieving a common goal by creating solutions for users. My goal at the end of this program
        is to be well grounded in software engineering, to continually improve on the knowledge acquired and to apply
        the knowledge gained to real life projects.</p>
