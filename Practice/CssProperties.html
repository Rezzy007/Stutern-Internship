            <h2>What I learned this week at Stutern</h2>
            <p>This week, we talked about the <b><i>importance of CSS</i></b> and looked at some common CSS properties used in styling web pages. CSS is used to control the outlook of a web page in a way that could be visually pleasing to users. We also discussed and practiced: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Types of CSS</li>
                    <li>Fundamental concepts of CSS; the cascade, specificity, and inheritance</li>
                    <li>CSS Box Model</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Difference between padding, margin and border in CSS</h2>
            <h3 class="spaces">Padding</h3>
            <p>This is the inner space between the content and the border of an element. It controls how much space exists within an element.</p>
            <h3 class="spaces">Border</h3>
            <p>This is the perimeter of an element. Borders can be made visible or invisible.</p>
            <h3 class="spaces">Margin</h3>
            <p>This is the outer space surrounding an element. The image below is used to further illustrate the definitions.</p>
